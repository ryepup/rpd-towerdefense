* Summary

  This is a hobby project to make a turn-based towerdefense game.
  This will be a more asynchronous game, where you set up the towers
  then hit "go".

  The "story" if I ever get around to making it, will be something
  sci-fi-ish where the player is a deep-space miner and goes into
  suspended animation for long periods of time, waking up to shore up
  the defenses.

* Todo
** foundation crap
** get a grid for the playing board
** simulation
* Implementation
** lisp for simulations 
** sdl for rendering
